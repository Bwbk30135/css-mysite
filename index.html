            <h3>Brand Design</h3>
            <p>I'm hugely passionate about helping businesses discover their brand DNA - what makes them unique and what gives them that spark. I help brands come to life visually, tell their story creatively, and find their perfect customers.</p>

            <h3>Brand Strategy</h3>
            <p>I work with brands to help them grow, scale and evolve. My clients all start at a different point on their journey. 
                Some have brand new businesses, some have been going a few years and are finding their feet. 
                Some are established with clear direction. They all have different goals, and varying resources. I help them make the most of what they do have, 
                and find a creative workaround for what they don't!</p>
